What is Exception?
- It's an event that occurs during the execution of the program
- It will disrupt your normal program flow
- It creates the Exception object which contains information about the Error like 
  1. Its type of exception and  Message
  2. Stack trace etc.
- Runtime System uses this Exception object and find the class which can handle it.


What is the difference between Error and Exception?
- Error is a situation which is not in our control. Eg. OutofMemoryError, StackOverflowError
- Generally errors are related to the JVM issues.
- Exceptions are respected to our code. We have certain control over that.


Types of Exceptions:
1. Compile Time Exception(checked) -->Code will not compiled if this exception is present. We have to manually handle those exceptions. 
   - ClassNotFoundException
   - InterruptedException
   - IOException
   - SQLException 
2. Runtime Exception(unchecked) --> Code will properly get compiled but during the runtime issues will be arised.
   - ClassCastException
   - ArithmeticException
   - IndexOutofBoundException
   - NullPointerException
   - IllegalArgumentException --> NumberFormatException


How to handle the exception?
1. Try/Catch:
   - Try block specify the code which can throw exception
   - Try block is followed by either catch or finally block
   - Catch block is used to catch all the exceptions which can be throwed in the try block
   - Multiple Catch block can be 
2. Finally:
   - Finally block can be use after try or catch block.
   - Finally block will always get executed, either if you return from try block or from catch block
   - At most we can add only 1 finally block.
   - Mostly used for closing the objects, adding logs etc
   - If JVM related issues like out of memory, system shut down or our process is forcefully killed then finally block will not be executed
 

 Advantages to handle the exception
 - It makes our code clean by seperating the error handling code from regular code
 - It allows program to recover from the error.
 - It allows us to add more information which supports debugging.
 - Improves security by hiding the sensitive information.


 **Exception Handling is expensive if the stack trace is huge!!!
