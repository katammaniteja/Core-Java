Two threads, a producer and a consumer, share a common, fixed-size buffer as a queue.
The producer's job is to generate data and put it into the buffer, while the consumer's job is to consume
the data from the buffer.
The problem is to make sure that the producer won't produce data if the buffer is full, and the consumer
won't consume data if the buffer is empty.
