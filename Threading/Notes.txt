Why Stop, Resume, Suspended method is deprecated?
STOP: Terminates the thread abruptly, No lock release, No resource cleanup happens.
SUSPEND: Put the thread on hold(suspend) for temporarily. No lock is release too..
RESUME: Used to resume the execution of Suspended thread.
These operation could result in deadlock.


JOIN METHOD:
- When JOIN method is invoked on a thread object current thread will be blocked and waits for specific thread to finish.
- It is helpful when we want to coordinate between threads or to ensure that we complete certain task before moving ahead.


THREAD PRIORITY:
- Priorities are integers ranging from 1 to 10.
  1-> low priority
  2-> highest priority
- Even we set the thread priority while creation, its not guranteed to follow any specific order, its just a hint to thread 
  scheduler which to execute next.(but it's not strict rule)
- When new thread created it inherits the priority of its parent thread
- we can set custom priority using "setPriority(int)" method.


DAEMON THREAD:
- Daemon thread will only alive till one one of the any other thread is alive.
Examples: Garbage Collector, Autosave
- Logging is also an example. We should do logging only when the program is running. As soon as program finished working Logging
  thread will also be removed.
